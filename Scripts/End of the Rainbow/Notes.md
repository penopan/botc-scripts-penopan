# End of the Rainbow
This script was designed before the Magician and Scarlet Woman jinxes were changed (October 2025). The Magician uses the spicy version of the jinx (https://www.instagram.com/p/C8EDWiEyYDl/), and the Scarlet Woman jinx has been weakened slightly. These both reflect in the json and pdf. Use the night order listed on the script.

It is intentional that the Assassin, Godfather, and Lycanthrope can kill the Magician at night. Lil' Monsta has trouble closing out games with only one evil player left alive. If it feels too bad, use Storm Catcher.
